ARCHIVED PROJECT - MOVED TO GITLAB: https://gitlab.com/TonyMHoyle/AssimpNet.Mobile

This is an unofficial build of assimpnet for Android and iOS.    A .NET Wrapper for the Open Asset Import (Assimp) library. The library is able to import dozens of different 3D model formats (e.g. OBJ, FBX, Collada) and export to several formats (e.g. OBJ, Collada). This release targets version 5.0.0 of the native library.  Original source at https://bitbucket.org/Starnick/assimpnet/src/master/

Note: For iOS builds you need to put -nosymbolstrip in the additional mtouch arguments otherwise it won't find the library symbols.
